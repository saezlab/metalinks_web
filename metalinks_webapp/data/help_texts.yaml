multiselect_cellloc:
    Choose the relevant cellular location in which the metabolite should be found.
    Available options are Cytoplasm, Endoplasmic reticulum, Extracellular, Golgi apparatus, 
    Lysosome, Membrane, Mitochondria, Nucleus, Peroxisome.

multiselect_tissue:
    Choose the relevant tissue in which the metabolite should be found.
    Available options are Adipose Tissue, Adrenal Cortex, Adrenal Gland, Adrenal Medulla, All Tissues,
    Bladder, Brain, Epidermis, Fibroblasts, Heart, Intestine, 
    Kidney, Leukocyte, Lung, Neuron, Ovary, Pancreas, Placenta,
    Platelet, Prostate, Skeletal Muscle, Spleen, Testis, Thyroid Gland.

multiselect_biospec:
    Choose the relevant biospecimen in which the metabolite should be found.
    Available options are Blood, Cerebrospinal Fluid, Feces, Saliva, 
    Serum, Sweat, Urine, Bile, Amniotic Fluid.

slider_database:
    Select minimum STITCH database confidence score each interaction should have. 
    This value is treated as OR in combination with the other cutoffs.

checkbox_exo:
    Metalinks contains a list of exogenous metabolites. 
    Select to include these in the search results.

radio_purpose:
    You can display output either as table with a few summarizing plots and a download options,
    or as graph to visualize the network of metabolites and their interactions.
    The graph is limited in size and will fail to load if the number of metabolites is too large.
